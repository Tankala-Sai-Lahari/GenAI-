# GenAI-
course in GenAI introduction
*SageMaker-basic chatbot*
--------------------------
    creating the chatbot functionatity using python dictionaries and the will       respond according to the keywords.
*Building Enery Efficiency (Supervised learning)*
--------------------------------------------------
    in this we created an supervised alorithm for the scenario.
    we use libraries like :
---importing libraries----
pandas ,numpy , matplotlib.pylot, seaborn,sklearn where,
PANDAS: 
         pandas is a data manipulation package in Python for tabular data.DataFrames. 
NUMPY   :
        NumPy is a module for Python that allows you to work with  multidimensional arrays and matrices.
matplotlib.pyplot :
        a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure
SEABORN:
    Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures
SKLEARN:
    Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. It's built upon some of the technology you might already be familiar with, like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib
